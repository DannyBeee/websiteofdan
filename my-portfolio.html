        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The assignment: build a responsive website in a given style.</p>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">My probably biggest challenge of the year came very early. And since I have never coded much (maybe a couple times in high-school) this assignment was very new to me. I have spent many hours at caffees and at home trying to figure out the best way to make my first website responsive. Therefore I learned the basics - structure, color schemes, logos, use of gestalt principles etc. in a span of 2 weeks.</p>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">I built my website in black and red/pinkish color with high contrast between elements on the website which was characteristic for Swiss Design artists to use - I did a lot of research before actually executing the design. Beside that we were assigned to make a moodboard (also shown on the screenshot of the website at the bottom right) and style tile. The website consists of the basic navigation bar at the top with links to other pages and a navigation bar at the bottom with my socials. To make it responsive I used 3 columns to split my content on the page which then breaks (mobile, tablet, desktop) and slides under each other when changing the device/collapsing the browser - I used media queries. As I mentioned plenty of times - I love simplicity. That is why the website looks very basic with not many vibrant colors which also suited my moodboard for the style.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">I was very happy to make this project with my classmate Nikola and to this day this is one of my favourite projects we have done. The assignment was about helping the fellow future students on a quest of finding the accommodation which proved to be pretty hard in my case. We basically made it as if we were trying to help out ourselves a few months ago. We used the UI kits from Adobe Stock and Google to make the interface esthetically pleasing for the eye or make it as easy to get into as possible and it proved to be very functional. At the home or main page one can find 3 boxes which contain some general key words for the given topic. The huge problem that we have decided to solve was the language barrier. Therefore, we have created our website all in English so that every international student could understand itâ€™s content and find the information he is looking for.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">All in all this assignment taught us how to effectively recognise issues with different designs and solve them in a suitable way. The usage of different elements in our project has a purpose based on our analysis we did together before hand multiple times.</p>

              <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The assignment: do a desk research, observe a public space following one of given topics, prepare an interview on a given topic and present the research plus conduct analysis.</p>
              
              <img style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;" src="/images/data-collection.png" alt="Data collection slides.">
              
            
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">03.01.01a - In the desk research assignment part we were given a topic to follow and to do and collect a research on. I chose the topic - "Teenagers' use of social media in connection with bullying". This assignment has showed us how to correctly collect and then use the gathered information in a summarised fashion as well as how to stay organised when doing so.</p> 
              
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">03.01.01b - Observation part was about spectating in a public space. My chosen topic was the "bus journey" where I observed how people act in a certain situation when they are, for instance waiting for a bus or just taking the journey with me.</p>
              
               <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">03.01.01c - During our interview assignment part we had to conduct an interview with a person we know. We prepared a guide from which we would draw information when interviewing. We recorded the interview on a recorder/phone to have a record of it to use later when collecting all the data into one file. I chose a topic "Social media: What they use most and what it gives them in everyday life." and I interviewed my sister.</p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">03.01.01d , e , f - The last things we needed to do was to make a short survey (the challenges of internationals moving to Denmark), review the results and put it into our summary seen above, present it and analyze. This whole assignment served as an useful sort of training on how to properly collect the information and present it in a professional way.</p>

                <p style="padding-right: 15px">This group work was a week long project taking place from Monday until Friday. On the first day, after the group assembly we were given a task to create a map - long-term goal of the whole project, basically where we want this to end up or continue. On Tuesday we did the Crazy 8s, sketched solution and drew a storyboard with dividing everybody's role in the project. The next day was about deciding, supervoting and speed critique. On Thursday, every person in the group had to create a part of a prototype which we had then put together and tested (proved to be very intuitive at the end). Friday was the end of the road / pitch day where we presented our ideas in front of the class.</p>
                
                <p style="padding-right: 15px">Despite this exercise being very "rushed" (which was sort of a point of it) I think we did incredibly well executing it before the deadline. We wanted to create this simple yet pleasing experience when using our app with an emphasis on functionality of the whole project which, according to the response we received, went pretty well. For me this assignment was more about the presenting and cooperation aspect of it - I'm still learning how to present on a good level since that is my achilles heel in all of this and I think it thrusted me out of my comfort zone for little. And I think that is what makes us grow.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The assignment: make a sprite animation using Illustrator and post it on the website.</p>
        
        <img style="padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px;" src="/images/spriteAnimation.png" alt="My sprite animation.">
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">This was the first exercise of the Basic Animation module and I am not going to lie, it really tested me. For starters, when I was thinking about the topic and what my character should be, don't ask me why, but I did not listen to warnings about why not to choose a complicated character for the animation. Well, I chose Boba Fett that day. Boba Fett is an old trilogy Star Wars character, one of my favorites and not easy to draw or animate at all. So, to make things a little easier I decided to make a cartoon version. First I sketched the approximate look I wanted him to have and then I have made him in Adobe Illustrator using very simple objects, trying to keep his characteristic shapes such as helmet, jetpack or his blaster - which should be easily recognisable by every fan of his. To make him seem to move, I made a 256 x 1536 pixel artboard devided to 6 parts/frames. Every frame then had a part of the body changed in a way of movement, in my case jetpack flight with flames coming from both thrusters on his back and his body wobbling in the process.</p>

        <p style="text-decoration: none; padding-left: 15px;">I have also pushed it a little further and made <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mDSPSc7p99JOX02O53"> a GIF on Jakku.</a></p>

        <img style="padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px;" src="/images/JScontrolledBOBA.png" alt="My JS controlled animation.">
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Continuing the first assignment of the Animation module, we were given a task to make the whole animation controllable using JavaScript. To start off I used a simple buttons for my animations, placed them on the left hand upper corner. There are 4 buttons. 2 for the back animation and 2 for the front side animation of my Boba Fett character. As a part of this assignment we had to make an animated .SVG picture - in my case Boba Fett logo to match the theme of my work a tiny bit. The animation makes the outlines of the logo "slide" to draw the object when refreshed the page. I chose this animation because I have seen it before in my friends projects and wanted to learn how to do it myself. It is not pretty, but it works - have I had more time back then, I would have polished it a lot more.</p>
        
        <p style="padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px;">The link for the animation can be found <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://life-of-dan.com/JScontrolledBOBAFETT/index.html">HERE</a>.</p>

         <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The assignment: choose a project in a group from a number of examples, code it and submit (1 day assignment).</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">As a group, we chose to make a simple calculator for the assignment. First we made a simple HTML structure, CSS basically only served for making it more vibrant and nicer to look at. JavaScript was a little bit more tricky and we have only Addition and Subtraction working because of lack of time and knowledge back at the time of the assignment - it was the first time for all of us to experiment with such code. Our plan for the future was to implement the advanced functions to the calculator which I tried days later on my own.</p>
        
        <p style="padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px;">The link for the calculator can be found on our group member Andrei's domain over <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://andreimihutoni.com/pages/Simple_calculator.html">HERE</a>.</p>

         <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">The assignment: create an animated sequence that explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark to be a student.</p>
        
        <img style="padding-right: 15px; padding-left: 15px;" src="/images/onboarding.png" alt="Onboarding game.">
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Again, one of my favorites. This is a group assignment, where we decided to create an educational JavaScript game that would provide the user with some basic information that are necessary and lucrative to every newcomer in Denmark. You are in control of the main character - a suitcase - which represents the basics and essentials every person brings when coming to Denmark for the first time. In this case (pun intended) the essentials are not clothes but the information contained and provided in our game. The game really pushed my expectations and what I thought we were able to do. And in my opinion, it panned out really well.</p>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">We have divided the work between the four of us so that everybody would have the thing they are the best at on their shoulder in the duration of this assignment. My job was to create the moodboard, persona collage and style tile in the beggining of the assignment using Photoshop and Illustrator, then sketching the character and the environment for my teammates Nikola and Lana so they can start illustrating and coding the game. Before the peer review day, I have created the questions to ask the different teams about the projects and wrote a pitch I presented on our Peer review day to those teams so everyone can get the idea behind the project.</p>

        <img style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;" src="/images/FS-website.png" alt="Our website and video.">
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">Creating content is one of my favorite things to do, designing wise, so I approached this assignment with utmost optimism and a good feeling. We created a video and a site with the mindset of bringing people together for a cause and that was - not to waste food and share as much as possible. My role in this project as a whole was to shoot the video and draw a storyboard. We did that on a school rented Sony Alpha A58 in 1080p/24fps option (as the DSLR lens and sensor give better "film" feel to it then just a regular phone camera). As far as the location goes, we decided to choose the Christmas Market as we were casually talking near the place and saw the enormous portions people get when ordering food and further observation got us thinking that many people did not finish their meals and just threw them away. The majority of the shots in the video are wide angles with a few over the shoulder shots when unpacking the message. </p>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;">When it comes to storyboard, there are some changes in a final product that are not shown on the paper. Our initial plan was to shoot at the stores and caffees where people would give us out a package with the message on a paper (as shown and reworked in a final video). But that didn't really make sense with further testing we did and proved to be misleading in a way. So we'd let it go after we got the Christmas Market idea and went for that instead. Next thing that changed further into our production was the first and last shot/frames of the video. We wanted to add another little piece of story to the video so that our beginning and ending would match and make sense to the viewer (the typewriter giving us an order at the start and our "Join us" frame at the end).</p>
